<P>
    Why is exercise important for our health?
</P>
    <p>
     Exercise is important because it helps keep our body strong and active. Regular physical activity improves heart health and strengthens muscles and bones. It also helps control body weight and increases energy levels. Exercise supports better sleep and improves overall physical fitness. Staying active daily helps the body work more efficiently.

            <p>How does exercise help mental health?</p>
            <p>Exercise is not only good for the body but also for the mind. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and feelings of sadness. Physical activity releases endorphins, which improve mood and make you feel happier. Exercise can also improve focus and memory. Regular movement helps people feel more relaxed and confident.</p>
            <p>The executed instruction, or calculation, can involve basic arithmetic, comparing numbers, performing a function, or moving numbers around in memory. Since everything in a computing device is represented by numbers, you can think of the CPU as a calculator that runs incredibly fast. The resulting workload might start up Windows, display a YouTube video, or calculate compound interest in a spreadsheet.</p>

            <p>What are some simple exercises people can do daily?</p>
            <p>There are many simple exercises that can be done every day without special equipment. Walking, jogging, stretching, and cycling are easy ways to stay active. Exercises like jumping jacks or yoga can be done at home. Even short exercise sessions can be very helpful. Being consistent is more important than doing difficult workouts</p>
